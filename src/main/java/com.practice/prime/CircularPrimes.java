/**
 * Circular Prime : A circular prime is a prime number with the property
 * that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its
 * (base 10) digits will be prime.
 *
 * For example, 1193 is a circular prime,
 * since 1931, 9311 and 3119 all are also prime.
 * A circular prime with at least two digits can only consist of combinations of the digits
 * 1, 3, 7 or 9, because having 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 as the last digit makes the number divisible by 2,
 * and having 0 or 5 as the last digit makes it divisible by 5.
